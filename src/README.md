# Lift and Drag Aero Simulation

This project calculates the *Lift* and *Drag* forces acting on an object moving through air using basic aerodynamic principles.

## 💡 Formula Used

- *Lift (L)* = ½ × ρ × v² × A × Cl  
- *Drag (D)* = ½ × ρ × v² × A × Cd  

Where:
- ρ = Air density (kg/m³)
- v = Velocity (m/s)
- A = Wing area (m²)
- Cl = Lift coefficient
- Cd = Drag coefficient

## 📁 File Structure

- src/lift_drag_calculator.py: Python code that performs the Lift and Drag calculation.

## ✅ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
python src/lift_drag_calculator.py
